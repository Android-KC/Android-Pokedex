## Notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a sample mobile app for android that lists
and keeps track of pokemon by utilizing the https://pokeapi.co/ API with save states. The app
contains a list of all 151 original pokemons from the first arc and once clicked, displays info
about each pokemon in a different layout. The info consists of each pokemon's name, number, types,
an image, and a short description. Additionally, each pokemon will come with a "Catch" button 
that can be clicked to indicate that the pokemon has been caught. The state of the pokemon that
have been caught will be saved through reboots of the app.
