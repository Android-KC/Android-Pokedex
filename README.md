## Notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a sample mobile app for Android OS that lists
and keeps track of pokemon by utilizing the https://pokeapi.co/ API with save states. The app
contains a list of all 151 original pokemon from the first arc and once clicked,  the appdisplays info
about the chosen pokemon in a different layout. The info consists of the pokemon's name, number, type,
image, and a short description. Additionally, each pokemon comes with a "Catch" button that can
be clicked to indicate that the pokemon has been caught. The state of the pokemon that have been
caught will be saved through reboots of the app.
